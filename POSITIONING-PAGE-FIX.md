## 📄 Hero Section (Verified Correct)

The hero section is correct and not "FINTECH":

**Header:**
```
🏆 Category-Defining Investment Opportunity
Geographic Monopoly
in Regenerative Luxury
```

**Subtitle:**
"MayaRoyale occupies the ONLY hurricane & sargassum-free luxury beach resort location in Mexico and the Caribbean—creating an unassailable competitive position"

**Hero Stats (4 key metrics):**
- 0.45% - Of Mexican Coastline Protected
