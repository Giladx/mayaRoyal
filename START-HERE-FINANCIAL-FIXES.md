## Issue 1: Chart Animates on Page Load ✅ FIXED

**Before:** Chart started animating immediately when page loaded

**After:** Chart only animates when you scroll to it

**Test:** 
1. Open page, wait 5 seconds (chart stays empty)
2. Scroll to chart section (chart starts drawing)

## Issue 2: Top 4 Cards Not Animating ✅ FIXED

**Before:** Only "200" animated, others were static

**After:** All 4 cards now animate!
- 🏨 **200** → Counts from 0 to 200
- 📅 **Dec 2028** → Counts through years (2024→2025→2026→2027→2028)
- 📈 **7 Years** → Counts from 0 to 7
- 🏝️ **Isla Aguada** → Fades in smoothly

**After:** Tighter, cleaner spacing throughout

**Changes:**
- Section padding reduced 25%
