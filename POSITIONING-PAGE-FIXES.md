- Clear additional return calculation: "+$125K-$200K (+30-50% Higher Returns)"

### Math Verification:
**Standard Riviera Maya:**
- $100K initial @ 18-20% annually for 7 years ≈ $399K ✅

**MayaRoyale with Advantages:**
- $100K initial @ 22-25% annually for 7 years ≈ $525-600K ✅
- Additional return: $126K-$201K (matches "+$125K-$200K") ✅
- Percentage increase: 31.6%-50.4% (matches "+30-50%") ✅

The math is now correct and clearly presented!
