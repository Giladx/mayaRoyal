# ✅ SOLANA BADGE - WIDTH SHORTENED

## Date: January 12, 2026

---

## Change Made:
**Solana badge text shortened for better visual balance**

---

## Before:
```
⚡ Built on Solana • Blockchain-Backed Real Estate
```
(Wider, extending beyond the text below)

## After:
```
⚡ Built on Solana • Blockchain Real Estate
```
(Narrower, better aligned with content below)

---

## Visual Benefits:

1. ✅ **Better Alignment** - Now aligns more naturally with "$100M+ ... ISLA AGUADA, MEXICO"
2. ✅ **More Focused** - Creates tighter, more cohesive hero section
3. ✅ **Less Distracting** - Badge is subtle accent, not dominant element
4. ✅ **Cleaner Hierarchy** - Maintains message clarity while taking less space
5. ✅ **Removes Redundancy** - "Blockchain Real Estate" is clear without "Backed"

---

## What Was Removed:
- Removed "-Backed" (5 characters + hyphen)
- Message remains clear: "Blockchain Real Estate" conveys the same meaning

---

## File Updated:
✅ **index.html** - Line 698

---

## Result:
The badge now has a more balanced width that complements the text elements below it, creating better visual harmony in the hero section.

**STATUS: COMPLETE** ✅

**Preview:** Open index.html to see the more compact, balanced badge!
