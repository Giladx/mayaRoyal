# Technology Page - Fixed ✅

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Fixed Navigation (White on White)
**Before:** `nav-transparent` class made navigation invisible on white background
**After:** Changed to `nav-scrolled` - navigation now visible with proper contrast

### 2. ✅ Fixed Logo
The logo image URL is correct: `https://www.genspark.ai/api/files/s/CLWTmhof`
Navigation now uses proper scrolled state which shows the logo correctly.

### 3. ✅ Redesigned Green Metric Boxes
**Changes to `.solana-metric`:**
- More rectangular: `border-radius: 8px` (was 12px)
- More compact: `padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem` (was 1rem all around)
- Better alignment: `display: inline-block` with `min-width: 160px`

**Changes to `.metric-value`:**
- Smaller size: `1.5rem` (was 1.75rem)
- Heavier weight: `600` (was 300)
- Tighter spacing: `letter-spacing: 0.02em`

**Changes to `.metric-label`:**
- Smaller: `0.7rem` (was 0.85rem)
- More prominent: `font-weight: 700`
- Better spacing: `letter-spacing: 1.2px`

### 4. ✅ Fixed Token Standard Text
**Before:** "✓ ERC-20/SPL token standard implementation"
**After:** "✓ SPL token standard implementation (Solana)"

**Explanation:** Since MayaRoyale is built on Solana (as stated throughout the site), it uses SPL (Solana Program Library) tokens, not ERC-20 (which is Ethereum). The new text is clearer and more accurate.

## Result:
- Navigation is now visible
- Logo displays correctly  
- Green boxes are more rectangular, compact, and aligned
- Token standard accurately reflects Solana blockchain
