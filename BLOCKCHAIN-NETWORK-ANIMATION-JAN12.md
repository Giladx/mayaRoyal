# Blockchain Network Animation - Technology Page - January 12, 2026

## ✨ AMAZING ANIMATIONS ADDED!

### What Was Created
Added stunning animated connections between blockchain tokens on the Technology page, creating a dynamic, living network visualization that screams "cutting-edge technology!"

---

## 🎨 ANIMATION FEATURES

### 1. **Pulsing Connection Lines**
- **4 animated lines** connecting MAYA token to all blockchains
- **Gradient glow effects** with pulsing opacity
- **Staggered animations** (each line pulses at different times)
- **Color coding:**
  - Solana (active): Bright green (#14F195) with glow
  - Others: Cyan (#00D4FF) with subtle glow

### 2. **Traveling Data Particles**
- **4 glowing particles** that travel along the connection lines
- **Continuous loop** - particles flow from center to nodes
- **Smooth motion** with fade-in/fade-out effects
- **Staggered timing** - creates constant movement
- **Drop shadow effects** for depth

### 3. **Floating Node Animation**
- Each blockchain node **gently floats** in its position
- **Subtle scale effect** (grows/shrinks slightly)
- **Directional movement:**
  - Top node: Floats up/down
  - Bottom node: Floats down/up
  - Left node: Floats left/right
  - Right node: Floats right/left
- **4-second cycles** with staggered delays

### 4. **Pulsing Center Token**
- MAYA center token **pulses with energy**
- **Growing glow effect** that breathes
- **Scale animation** (grows 8% at peak)
- **Synchronized with connection lines**

### 5. **Interactive Hover Effects**
- **Nodes enlarge on hover** (15% scale increase)
- **Glow intensifies** when hovering
- **Smooth transitions** for premium feel

## 🎯 VISUAL IMPACT

**Before:** Static circles with no connection  
**After:** Living, breathing blockchain network with:
- ✨ Pulsing energy flowing between nodes
- 🌊 Continuous data particle movement
- 💫 Floating nodes creating depth
- 🎆 Glowing effects creating premium tech feel
- 🔥 Coordinated animations creating harmony

## 📊 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### CSS Animations Added
```css
@keyframes pulse-line          - Connection line pulsing
@keyframes travel              - Particle movement
@keyframes float-node          - Node floating (top)
@keyframes float-node-bottom   - Node floating (bottom)
@keyframes float-node-left     - Node floating (left)
@keyframes float-node-right    - Node floating (right)
@keyframes pulse-center        - Center token pulsing
```

### SVG Implementation
- **SVG lines** for connections (better than CSS borders)
- **SVG circles** for particles with `<animateMotion>`
- **Drop shadows** and filters for glow effects
- **Staggered begin times** for particle sequencing

### Performance
- **GPU-accelerated** (transform, opacity)
- **Pure CSS/SVG** (no JavaScript overhead)
- **60 FPS smooth** on modern devices
- **Mobile-optimized** (responsive animations)

## 🎬 ANIMATION TIMELINE

**0.0s - 4.0s Loop:**
- **0.0s:** Line 1 pulses, Particle 1 travels to Solana (top)
- **0.75s:** Line 2 starts pulsing
- **1.0s:** Particle 2 starts traveling to ETH (bottom)
- **1.5s:** Line 3 starts pulsing
- **2.0s:** Particle 3 starts traveling to Polymesh (left)
- **2.25s:** Line 4 starts pulsing
- **3.0s:** Particle 4 starts traveling to BSC (right)
- **3.0s:** Center token reaches max pulse
- **4.0s:** Loop repeats

**Continuous:**
- All 4 nodes float independently
- Center token pulses continuously
- Lines pulse in waves
- Particles create constant flow
