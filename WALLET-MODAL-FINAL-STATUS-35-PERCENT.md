## TO COMPLETE THE REMAINING 11 PAGES:

Each page needs the wallet modal code from `WALLET-MODAL-MINIFIED.txt` added before `</body>`.

**The modal code is ~5KB minified and includes:**

## NEXT STEPS:

I'll add the modal to the remaining 11 pages.
**Estimate:** 1-2 more responses

### Option 2: Manual Completion
You can copy the modal from `WALLET-MODAL-MINIFIED.txt` and paste it before `</body>` on each of the 11 remaining pages.
**Estimate:** 8-10 minutes
