# ✅ BADGE WIDTH & TEXT VISIBILITY FIXES

## Date: January 12, 2026

---

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Badge Frame Shortened (Left to Right)**
Made the badge container narrower to better match "BEACHFRONT" width horizontally.

**Changes to badge:**
- ✅ **Padding reduced:** `20px → 16px` (tighter frame)
- ✅ **Font size reduced:** `0.9rem → 0.8rem` (more compact)
- ✅ **Letter-spacing reduced:** `1px → 0.5px` (tighter text)
- ✅ **Max-width added:** `600px` (controls maximum width)

**Result:** Badge frame is now narrower and aligns better with "BEACHFRONT" width.

### 2. **"Meets Blockchain" - Visibility Fixed**
Changed from cyan (which gets lost against turquoise video) to **GOLD** for high contrast.

**Color change:**
- ❌ **Before:** `#00D4FF` (cyan - blends with turquoise video background)
- ✅ **After:** `#D4AF37` (gold - pops against turquoise, matches brand)
- ✅ **Added text-shadow:** `0 2px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)` (depth and readability)

**Result:** "Meets Blockchain" now stands out clearly against the video background.
