# CONNECT WALLET BUTTON - REMOVED ✅

## Date: January 12, 2026

---

## ✅ DONE

Removed the redundant **"Connect Wallet"** button from the bottom of the Technology page.

---

## 🔧 WHAT I CHANGED

**Location:** Bottom CTA section (before footer)

**Before:**
- 2 buttons: "Connect Wallet" + "Technical Questions?"

**After:**
- 1 button: "Technical Questions?" (now primary style)

## 💡 WHY IT MAKES SENSE

1. ✅ **Connect Wallet** already in navigation toolbar (all pages)
2. ✅ **Redundant** - users don't need it twice
3. ✅ **Cleaner design** - single focused CTA
4. ✅ **Better UX** - less confusion

## 📍 WHERE TO FIND CONNECT WALLET

Users can still connect via:

1. **Navigation toolbar** (top-right, golden button) ✅
2. **Mobile menu** (hamburger menu) ✅
3. Available on **every page** ✅

---

## 🎯 WHAT'S LEFT

**Single CTA:**
- **"Technical Questions?"** button
- Links to contact.html
- Perfect for tech inquiries
- Now styled as primary (more prominent)

---

## 📁 FILES MODIFIED

✅ **technology.html** - Line 543 (removed Connect Wallet button)

---

## 🚀 RESULT

**Before:** ❌ Redundant button, cluttered design  
**After:** ✅ Clean, focused CTA

---

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Impact:** Cleaner Technology page design!

The redundant button is gone, and users can still easily connect their wallet via the navigation toolbar! ✨
